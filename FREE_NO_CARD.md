# Free Hosting Options - No Credit Card Required

Since Fly.io requires a credit card, here are alternatives that don't require one:

## 🏆 Best Option: Render (No Credit Card Required)

**Why it's great:**
- ✅ **NO credit card required** for free tier
- ✅ Free SSL certificate
- ✅ Free custom domain
- ✅ PostgreSQL database included
- ✅ Auto-deployments from GitHub
- ⚠️ **Limitation:** Spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity (first request takes ~30 seconds)

**This is the best option if you don't want to provide a credit card.**

## Option 2: PythonAnywhere (Limited Free Tier)

**Why it's okay:**
- ✅ NO credit card required for free tier
- ✅ Always-on (no spin-down)
- ❌ Custom domain requires $5/month
- ❌ Limited resources on free tier

**Not ideal for custom domain without paying.**

---

## Option 3: Self-Host on Your Windows PC

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ Always-on (if PC stays on)
- ✅ Full control
- ❌ Requires PC to be on 24/7
- ❌ More setup and maintenance

**Best if you're okay with keeping your PC running.**

## 🎯 Recommendation: Use Render

Render is the best option because:
1. ✅ No credit card required
2. ✅ Free custom domain
3. ✅ Free SSL
4. ✅ Easy setup
5. ⚠️ Only limitation is spin-down (15 min inactivity)

**The spin-down means:**
- First visitor after 15+ minutes of inactivity waits ~30 seconds
- If you get regular traffic, it stays awake
- For a business site, this might be acceptable

## Next Steps

I can create a detailed Render deployment guide for you. Would you like me to:
1. Create Render deployment guide (no credit card needed)
2. Create self-hosting guide for your Windows PC (completely free, always-on)
3. Both?

Let me know which option you prefer!
